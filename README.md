# DATA-CLEANING-PROJECT
## 1. Introduction
- This case study aims to give an idea of data cleaning in a real survey scenario. In this case study, we will develop a basic understanding of economic characteristics like EMPLOYMENT STATUS, COMMUTING TO WORK, OCCUPATION, INDUSTRY,CLASS OF WORKER, INCOME AND BENEFITS and HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE and understand how data is used to understand the society.

# 2. About Dataset
- This data is taken from US Govt. site https://data.census.gov/ under the "DP03: SELECTED ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS". This survey is done by American Comunity Survey(ACS).This survey data is divided into main 8 catagories and each catagories divided into two sub catagories are civilian and armed force peoples of the United State of America of different demographics.
- Let explore the structure of survey data 
    1. EMPLOYMENT STATUS
    2. COMMUTING TO WORK
    3. OCCUPATION
    4. INDUSTRY
    5. CLASS OF WORKER
    6. INCOME AND BENEFITS 
    7. HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE
    8. PERCENTAGE OF FAMILIES AND PEOPLE WHOSE INCOME IN THE PAST 12 MONTHS IS BELOW THE POVERTY LEVEL


The 2021 American Community Survey (ACS) data generally reflect the March 2020 Office of Management and Budget (OMB) delineations of metropolitan and micropolitan statistical areas. In certain instances the names, codes, and boundaries of the principal cities shown in ACS tables may differ from the OMB delineations due to differences in the effective dates of the geographic entities.

Estimates of urban and rural populations, housing units, and characteristics reflect boundaries of urban areas defined based on Census 2010 data. As a result, data for urban and rural areas from the ACS do not necessarily reflect the results of ongoing urbanization.

**Explanation of Symbols:**<br>
**(-)**	
The estimate could not be computed because there were an insufficient number of sample observations. For a ratio of         medians estimate, one or both of the median estimates falls in the lowest interval or highest interval of an open-ended     distribution. For a 5-year median estimate, the margin of error associated with a median was larger than the median         itself.<br>

**(N)**	The estimate or margin of error cannot be displayed because there were an insufficient number of sample cases in the       selected geographic area.<br>

**(X)**	The estimate or margin of error is not applicable or not available.<br>

**median-**	The median falls in the lowest interval of an open-ended distribution (for example "2,500-")<br>

**median+**	The median falls in the highest interval of an open-ended distribution (for example "250,000+").<br>

(**)	The margin of error could not be computed because there were an insufficient number of sample observations.<br>

(***)	The margin of error could not be computed because the median falls in the lowest interval or highest interval of an         open-ended distribution.<br>

(*****)  A margin of error is not appropriate because the corresponding estimate is controlled to an independent population or housing estimate. Effectively, the corresponding estimate has no sampling error and the margin of error may be treated as zero.
